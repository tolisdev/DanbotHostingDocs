# Getting Started

### Creating an account
First, let's create our account. You need to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/dbh) and then go to the commands channel. You need to run `DBH!user new` and then navigate to the channel created only for you. You shall reply to the bot's questions and then login to the [panel](https://panel.danbot.host) using the credentials provided by the bot.

### Creating our new server
After creating our account, we are ready to create our brand new server. There are many server categories. We can view all of the available server categories using the `DBH server create` command. After choosing the server type that we want to use, we can run the `DBH!server create <server_type> <server_name>`. Congrats, we just got our server! If you have an error reported on the screen, you may go to the [Errors](https://dbh.tolis.tech/docs/errors/) section.
